<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bioprosthesis Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Porcine Tissue</li><li>Bovine Tissue</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bioprosthesis valves are heart valve replacements made from animal tissues, primarily porcine (pig) and bovine (cow) sources. Porcine tissue valves are widely used due to their favorable hemodynamic properties and compatibility with the human body. Bovine tissue valves offer durability and a larger surface area, making them suitable for specific patient needs. Both types undergo sterilization processes to minimize rejection risks, and they are favored for their natural appeal and lower anticoagulation requirements compared to mechanical valves.</p></p>
