<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chemical Foam Blowing Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Endothermic</li><li>Exothermic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The chemical foam blowing agents market consists of two primary types: endothermic and exothermic agents. Endothermic blowing agents absorb heat during the foam formation process, leading to a cooling effect and creating stable foam structures, often used in thermal insulation applications. In contrast, exothermic agents release heat when they decompose, promoting the formation of foam through gas expansion. This type is typically utilized for packaging and construction materials, balancing efficiency with product strength and performance.</p></p>
